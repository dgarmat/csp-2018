# Example code for CSP 2018 presentation

The repository shows example code that I used to 

+ Make a simulated data set, 
+ Examine the missingness, 
+ Specify the imputation model,
+ Perfrom multiple impuation with the `mice` package, 
+ Calculate a number of agreement statistics, and
+ Pool the results with `mice`.
